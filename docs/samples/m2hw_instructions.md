Bonus: Add suggested improvements.

This is an assignment with a lot of parts, so I recommend you tackle one problem at a time. Try to get a basic version working before adding in improvements.
You can either write multiple short programs, or make one program that answers each question. Either way, be sure to label your work with cout statements such as "Question 1", etc. to make the output easy to follow.

Question 1. Write a program that simulates banking transactions using the following requirements.

The program should ask the user for their name. It should then ask for the following information (all units are dollars):

    Starting account balance

    Amount of deposit

    Amount of withdrawal

The program should then display the following information:

    Name on the account

    Account number ( you can generate this any way you see fit -- a number you pick, or a random number, for example )

    Final account balance.

(Suggested improvements: Allow the name to contain whitespace, and print all money amounts with two decimal places. The techniques needed to do both are found in “Gaddis Chapter 3 Slides” under Resources.)

Question 2. Use the M2LAB1 program as a base for this question.

General Crates has found that the updated cost per cubic foot for storage is now 0.3, due to economic fluctuations.
Management has determined that they cannot currently raise their charge per cubic foot above 0.52 without losing customers.
Modify the program to match these new conditions.

(Suggested improvements: print all money amounts with two decimal places. The technique to do this is found in the “Gaddis Chapter 3 Slides” under Resources.)

Question 3. You are throwing a pizza party. Each visitor should get three slices of pizza.

The program should ask how many pizzas you order, how many slices per pizza, and how many visitors are coming.
The program should calculate and display how many pieces of pizza are left over.

Question 4. Since FTCC has sports teams, you've been hired to write a cheering program.

The program should output this message:

Let's go FTCC

Let's go FTCC

Let's go FTCC

Let's go Trojans

 

You should use the following variables in your cout statements:

string school, team; 

Suggested Improvements: For bonus points, meet these additional constraints:

A. You can't print out any raw strings ("that look like this"), only string variables.
B. you can only use these string variables:
string letsGo, school, team, cheerOne, cheerTwo;
C. You must use string concatenation to build the strings cheerOne and cheerTwo .
String concatenation means to use the + operator. An example:
string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
Once you've finishing answering these questions, upload screenshots of the running program and your ZIP of the source code as usual.
If you're having trouble working with all of these questions in the same file, it is OK for you to create separate files such as M2HW1_Lastname_Q1, and so on. We will cover how to better organize large files in future modules.
