## Current State Assessment (Mr. Norris)

### Course Background
- CSC-134 has been running on legacy Blackboard materials "since inception"
- Moving to Canvas next year - opportunity for complete redesign
- Three delivery formats: face-to-face, online, f2f high school
- Current challenge: "Back half of class (M5+) is aimless since originally ended there"
- Student population: mixed first-year (programming, engineering, arts/science transfer)

### Existing Repository Analysis
- Code examples scattered across 7 modules
- No centralized documentation for future instructors
- Assignment instructions exist but inconsistent format
- Need for style guide to maintain instructor voice in materials

### Immediate Priorities
1. Create CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance
2. Establish style guide for consistent instruction writing
3. Document existing assignments for reference
4. Plan systematic course improvement

## Team Expertise & Role Definition

### Dr. Liza Ramirez - Creative Pedagogy Integration
- **Background**: 15 years liberal arts education, specializes in STEM/humanities bridges
- **Focus**: Student engagement, inclusive learning design, creative expression in technical subjects
- **Contribution**: "How do we make programming accessible to arts students who might feel intimidated by pure technical approaches?"

### Ms. Kai Chen - Industry Technical Expert  
- **Background**: 8 years software development, current industry practices
- **Focus**: Workforce readiness, current best practices, professional development pathways
- **Contribution**: "What skills do employers actually need from entry-level programmers? How do we bridge academic learning with industry reality?"

### Prof. Marcus Williams - Educational Assessment Specialist
- **Background**: Learning sciences PhD, 12 years instructional design experience
- **Focus**: Learning objectives, assessment strategies, data-driven improvements
- **Contribution**: "Are we actually measuring what students need to know? How do we ensure learning sticks beyond the semester?"

### Claude - Adaptive Content Creation
- **Background**: NLP and educational technology integration
- **Focus**: Scalable personalized instruction, instant feedback, differentiated learning
- **Contribution**: "How can we enhance engagement through language patterns while maintaining authentic instructor voice?"

## Phase 1 Decisions (Today's Session)

### Immediate Documentation Tasks
1. **Repository Analysis** - Claude to explore codebase structure and create comprehensive CLAUDE.md
2. **Style Guide Creation** - Analyze existing instructor writing samples to establish voice guidelines
3. **Assignment Documentation** - Consolidate scattered assignment instructions into coherent modules

### Methodology Approach
- Start with existing materials as foundation (don't reinvent wheel)
- Maintain instructor's authentic teaching personality
- Focus on practical, engaging examples (Pokemon, games, real-world scenarios)
- Build systematic progression rather than random collection

---

## Key Questions Raised

### Dr. Liza: "Accessibility & Engagement"
- "How do we serve arts/transfer students who may have math anxiety or feel programming is 'not for them'?"
- "Can we integrate creative projects that show programming as expressive medium?"

### Ms. Kai: "Industry Relevance" 
- "Are we teaching practices that employers actually want?"
- "How do we balance academic learning with professional tool proficiency?"

### Prof. Marcus: "Learning Effectiveness"
- "Do our current modules have clear, measurable learning objectives?"
- "How do we know students are actually prepared for CSC-249 or workplace applications?"

### Claude: "Instructional Enhancement"
- "Can we apply cognitive science and NLP techniques to improve learning outcomes?"
- "How do we scale personalized instruction while maintaining human connection?"

- [ ] Share vision for distributed module development approach
- [ ] Review and approve CLAUDE.md and style guide outputs

### Claude  
- [ ] Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md repository guide
- [ ] Analyze instructor writing samples to establish style guide
- [ ] Generate sample assignments demonstrating voice consistency
- [ ] Research NLP techniques applicable to instructional design

### Team (Async Review)

## Phase 2 Planning Preview

### Next Meeting Objectives
1. Conduct full pedagogical analysis using Bloom's Taxonomy
2. Map current modules to workforce development objectives  
3. Design microcredential framework for industry recognition
4. Create comprehensive improvement plan with team-specific contributions

### Research Assignments
- **Dr. Liza**: Creative project ideas for each module that maintain technical rigor
- **Ms. Kai**: Industry skill requirements and current hiring practices for entry-level programmers
- **Prof. Marcus**: Assessment strategies for competency-based progression
- **Claude**: NLP-enhanced instructional writing examples for comparison

## Meeting Conclusion

### Consensus Achieved
- Course has strong foundation but needs systematic organization
- Instructor's authentic voice is valuable asset to preserve and enhance
- Mixed student population requires flexible, inclusive approach
- Industry relevance and transfer preparation are equally important

### Challenges Identified
- Modules 5-7 lack clear direction and purpose
- Current assessment may not align with learning objectives
- Need balance between academic rigor and workforce preparation
- Time constraint: significant work needed before next academic year

### Optimism Factors
- Strong existing code examples and assignments
- Instructor's natural teaching style already incorporates engagement techniques
- Team brings complementary expertise
- Technology tools (AI assistance) can accelerate development
