# Instructor Style Guide for CSC-134

## Voice Characteristics

### Conversational & Approachable
- Uses casual, friendly tone: "Let's start writing some C++ code"
- Direct address to students: "You'll now see three windows in your browser"
- Parenthetical asides for additional context: "(Why that phrase in particular? No idea. But it's tradition.)"
- Informal explanations: "This saves a lot of time" 

### Clear Structure with Signposting
- Uses **TO DO:** markers for student actions
- Breaks content into clear sections: "Part I -- Background", "Part 2 – Assignment"
- Provides clear transitions: "With that in mind...", "To recap..."
- Numbered steps for procedural tasks

### Practical & Example-Driven
- Provides real-world analogies: "Go to the store and pick up some milk"
- Shows incorrect/correct versions: "That is really hard to read, so we break it up..."
- Includes common errors section with specific fixes
- Uses relatable examples: movies, apples, pizza

### Encouraging & Supportive
- Acknowledges difficulty: "C++ error messages are not exactly user friendly to new programmers. Don't worry – you'll get the hang of it."
- Celebrates success: "If you didn't get any errors, congratulations!"
- Provides options: "Method One: Snipping Tool" vs "Method Two: Copy / Paste + MSWord"

### Technical Writing Patterns
- Defines terms immediately: "integers (often called 'whole numbers')"
- Explains acronyms/abbreviations: "Double stands for 'double precision floating point number', but we'll use the short name"
- Uses code formatting consistently
- Provides complete working examples

## Common Phrases & Patterns

### Introductions
- "First off, welcome to..."
- "Today we're going to work with..."
- "Let's start writing some C++ code"

### Instructions
- "TO DO: [specific action]"
- "Replace [placeholder] with [actual value]"
- "Run this code and make sure it works without errors"

### Explanations
- "Here's what's going on..."
- "The important point to remember is..."
- "It's worth mentioning that..."

### Troubleshooting
- "If you get errors..."
- "Common Errors and How To Fix Them"
- "Double check your..."

## Assignment Format

1. **Title Block**: Course number, assignment code, brief description
2. **Introduction**: Brief context or motivation
3. **Background** (if needed): Historical/conceptual information
4. **Assignment Steps**: Clear procedural instructions with TO DO markers
5. **Common Errors**: Troubleshooting section
6. **Finishing Up**: Checklist of requirements
7. **Submitting Your Work**: File naming and submission instructions

## File Naming Convention
- Always uses format: `M[module][type]_lastname.[extension]`
- Reminds students: "(Obviously use your own last name.)"

## Cultural References
- Programming traditions ("Hello World")
- Pop culture (Monty Python: "It's only a flesh wound")
- Historical context (1980s computing)

## Teaching Philosophy
- Step-by-step verification: "Run it after each step"
- Scaffolding: References previous assignments for similar patterns
- Multiple submission formats accepted
- Optional bonus work encouraged but not required
