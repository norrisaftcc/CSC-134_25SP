# anime hustle

so i tried a diss track

i know anime is your pass-word
thanks for your cashapp, nerd

and this is the response suno gave

--
[Verse]
Lounge singer spinnin', serenadin' the stars,
Snorlax snoozin' hard, dreamin' of Mars,
Pikachu shocks, voltage hits like bars,
Broly ragin', breakin' chains and cars.

[Verse 2]
Student yap, givin' grief in the hall,
Data mine passwords, break through the wall,
Lunch money snatched, bullies stand tall,
Anime heroes ready for the brawl.

[Chorus]
Nerds rise up, hearts beat loud,
Triumphant tale, proud and unbowed,
Stand your ground, never be cowed,
Fightin' spirit, echo to the crowd.

[Verse 3]
Virtual worlds, digital dreams collide,
Snorlax guarding, secrets they hide,
Pikachu strikes, thunder's wild ride,
Broly rampage, power unsupplied.

[Bridge]
Lounge singer's rift, melody so sweet,
Anime fusion, rhythm's heartbeat,
Nerds in the halls, unyielding feat,
Stand together, no retreat.

[Verse 4]
Heroes in shadows, wit and might,
Passwords crack, influence in sight,
Lunch money warriors, ready to fight,
Anime champions, shine in the night.
